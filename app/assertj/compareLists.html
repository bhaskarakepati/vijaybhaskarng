			    <h3>AssertJ, writing tests just got simpler..</h3>
			     With AssertJ you can write your tests and assert the results in much efficient and quicker way
			     <h4>We can use the below code to compare two lists with assertJ</h4>
			     <h3>Below code will compare the below points in two lists </h3>
			     	<ul>
			     		<li>Whether 2 lists has the same size. If two lists has the differenet size then assert will be failed</li>
			     		<li>if the lists contain objects then it will also compare all fields in the object to make sure all fields are same</li>
			     		<li>it will also check whether both lists has objects or Strings in same order</li>
			     	</ul>
			     <pre> <code class="java">
List<Item> expectedList = new ItemsProvider().getItems();
List<Item> actualList = new ItemsProvider().getItems();

assertThat(expectedList).usingFieldByFieldElementComparator().containsExactlyElementsOf(actualList);

<h3>Below code will do the same thing but it doesn't care about order of the objects in the lists</h3>
