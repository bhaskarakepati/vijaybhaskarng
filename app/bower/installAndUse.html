	<h3 class="bowerHeading">Install Bower</h3>
	<p> Bower is a command line utility. You can install it with npm (Node Package Manager)</p>
	<p> bower requires node, npm and git. So we have to install them before installing bower. </p>
	<p class="bower-command"> $ npm install -g bower</p>
	<p><b>-g</b> means It will install bower globally. So that we can run bower from any where in the system. Not just from the installed directory.</p>
